Starting parallel pool (parpool) using the 'local' profile ...
{Error using parpool (line 151)
You requested a minimum of 32 workers, but the cluster "local" has the
NumWorkers property set to allow a maximum of 1 workers. To run a communicating
job on more workers than this (up to a maximum of 512 for the Local cluster),
increase the value of the NumWorkers property for the cluster. The default
value of NumWorkers for a Local cluster is the number of physical cores on the
local machine.
